# ImprovedRecipeFinder
An improved recipe finder app using ideas from the Advanced Android class

To build this project, you will need to apply for your own api key from http://food2fork.com/about/api .  A basic plan is free.  

When you receive your API key from food2fork, add the following attribute to your gradle.properties file using this format

API_KEY = "your api key goes here"

In Android studio, then click on Build -> Rebuild Project.  The project will then build and become usable to you.
